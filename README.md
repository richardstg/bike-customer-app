# Customer App for Scooter Sharing Service

This application is part of a larger project in the course "pattern" at BTH.

React was used to build the application, and it is part of a complete full-stack scooter sharing application. The system consists of a backend build with express.js (and MongoDB) and three front-end applications. The application is one of these three, and it functions as the customer's app for renting scooters. It allows users to log in with Google OAuth and view a map of the cities where the service is operating and rent available scooters.
